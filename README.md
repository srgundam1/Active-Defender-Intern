## Face Detection
This folder operates with face detection where the program will detect and output the number of faces within the frame. It also has a button that, when clicked, displays a popup with camera panning instructions as well as a "Faces Detected: " count. The popup is reusable and can be customized. Currently, the face detection can pick up false positives.

## Face Recognition
This folder recognizes or authenticates faces in the frame using a stored database of images capturing different angles of a single face. The program will initially collect several images of the person for reference, and then switch to recognition where the mouse is clicked anywhere on the screen.
